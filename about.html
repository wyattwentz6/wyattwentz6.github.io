        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p> 
          Growing up in Washington state I have always taken interest in 
          computers and video games because of many of the companies localed there
          like Mircosoft. When I was in 9th grade one of my classes went on a 
          field trip to Mircosoft and that cemented my love of computers even more.
          After graduting High School in Washington my family decided to move to New Jersey
          which is where I currently live and go to Rowan University. My goal is to move back to Washington but I also 
          want to explore and work in many different places before I deside to settle down there.
          But I have grown to love the east coast and many cities like NYC, Philly, and D.C.
          I also have an interest in cars. I love to get my hands dirty sometimes and have 
          learned a lot from working on them like patience, following steps, and using my muscles.
          The last one not so much but I do love working on cars as a hobby.
